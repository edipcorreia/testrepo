## cbioportalR test

In this test I will try to make a simple graph with data from the
`cbioportalR` package.  
The graph will be a barplot with bars for each type of cancer and their
respective mutated gene.

###### Let’s install the packages

``` r
install.packages("cbioportalR")
install.packages("dplyr")

library("cbioportalR")
library("dplyr")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](test-cbioportalR_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
