knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE,
  warning = FALSE
  )
```

## cbioportalR test

In this test I will try to make a simple graph with data from the `cbioportalR` package.  
The graph will be a barplot with bars for each type of cancer and their respective mutated gene.  

###### Let's install the packages

```{r install and load, message='hide'}
install.packages("cbioportalR")
install.packages("dplyr")

library("cbioportalR")
library("dplyr")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
