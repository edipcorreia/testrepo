## cbioportalR test

In this test I will try to make a simple graph with data from the `cbioportalR` package.  
The graph will be a barplot with bars for each type of cancer and their respective mutated gene.  

###### Let's install the packages

```{r install and load, message='hide'}
install.packages("cbioportalR")
install.packages("tidyverse")

library("cbioportalR")
library("tidyverse")
```

###### Checking the database

Set the `cbioportal` database

```{r database setup}
set_cbioportal_db(db = "public")

```

Great success! Now let's have a look at what we're dealing with...

```{r available_studies}
available_studies() %>% 
  head(n = 10)

```

Lot's of variables, maybe it's easier to check which one's are the most useful.

```{r check columns}
colnames(available_studies())


```
